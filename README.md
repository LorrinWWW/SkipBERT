# SkipBERT

Code associated with the paper **[SkipBERT: Efficient Inference with Shallow Layer Skipping](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.503/)**, at ACL 2022


Thank you for your interests! The code is still under construction so should be updated frequently.
We will release the pretrained checkpoints recently (hopefully this weekend).
